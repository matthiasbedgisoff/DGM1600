
The If statements are used to for testing if a condition is true or false.
An example was for our number guessing game. 
If the number was higher than 50 then the command will be executed to guess a higher number. 
We can give it more if commands to be able to process many other steps when an action is taking place. 
If statements can have many conditions as will. 
If you want it to check more than one condition you can use two types of operations. 
The first one is the AND operator which is written as “&&”. 
This operator means that all the conditions inside the parentheses must all be true for the code to be executed. 
The other operator is the OR operator which is written “||”. 
Unlike the AND operator only one condition in the parentheses needs to be true.
